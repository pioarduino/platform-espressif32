* The official [PlatformIO Documentation](https://docs.platformio.org/page/platforms/espressif32.html) should be consulted first regarding advanced usage, packages, boards, frameworks, etc.

All issues caused from boards (wrong/missing) will ***not*** be fixed by the maintainer(s).

A PR needs to be provided to solve.
