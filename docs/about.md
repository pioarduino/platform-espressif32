# A fork of the [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org) Espressif 32 development platform

The Espressif ESP32 series are highly integrated low-cost, low-power system on a chip microcontrollers with models including integrated Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. ESP32 variants with wireless capabilities integrate an antenna switch, RF balun, power amplifier, low-noise receive amplifier, filters, and power management modules.

For years, application development for the Espressif Systems ESP32 series of microcontrollers was supported by PlatformIO via an agreement between Espressif Systems and PlatformIO

In mid-2024, the business agreement between PlatformIO and Espressif Systems changed. As a result Espressif arduino-esp32 core versions after v2.0.17 are no longer officially supported by PlatformIO.

This fork was then created as a community supported project to continue to develop and support developers wishing to use PlatformIO with Espressif arduino-esp32 core versions 3 and greater.
