# About ***pioarduino*** Documentation

Contributions to the documentation for the ***pioarduino*** project are welcome!

Documentation for this project is compiled using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org). It is a lightweight toolset that can easily be installed and used on all platforms that support Python version 3, making it very suitable for developers to install and use.

Source files are in [Markdown format](https://www.markdownguide.org), and also use the [MkDocs extensions](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/writing-your-docs/#tables) as documented on their site.

The Markdown formatting syntax is very simple and can be picked up in minutes, again making it very easy for developers to contribute to the project.

Use of simple formatting HTML tags are permitted within Markdown files as long as they do not modify the style sheets or override any other attributes of the theme used to generate the documentation.
